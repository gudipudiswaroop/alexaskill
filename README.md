# TechGig 2018 Alexa Hackathon finalist idea
Out of 6000 plus participants, our idea of well-being guru got shortlisted as top10 teams for final Techgig 2018 hackathon event.

# What is the alexa skill well-being guru
Well-being guru is a personal assistant that integrates with user's google fit and monitors daily activities of the user. It also generates diet plans, health tips etc based on user's daily/weekly progress.
The skill acts as a fitness trainer and adds activities like running/cycling/swimming etc to user's google calendar based on user's progress.
All that user has to do is enable the skill in alexa skill store, authenticate with user's gmail account, input with user's target and actual weights. That's it, now the skill will act as a real time fitness trainer.
